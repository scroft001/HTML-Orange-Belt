# HTML-Orange-Belt
 All of the completed HTML orange belt projects for Hackingtons.com. Teacher resource

The goal of the orange belt is to get the students some exposure to JavaScript. We have an entire course on it. Pay special attention to the students that like this more than the rest of HTML and you can send them over to JS after they finish the blue belt here.

These projects might take more than one class to finish each. Most students like to go above and beyond.

Target ages: 9+ or 8+ if they have some coding experience.

This is going to seperate the kids who like "coding" and those that just like building websites.

The topic can be chosen by the student but the functionality of the sites should match.

Make sure all students watch the skill videos first.

# Common-problems:
    1) Forgetting () in their function calls
    2) Syntax in the JS
    3) Not linking their JS file properly
    4) Not putting the onclick inside the opening tag
    5) onlick instead of onclick
